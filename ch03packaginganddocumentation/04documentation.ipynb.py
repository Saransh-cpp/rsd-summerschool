# # Documentation
# 
# ## Documentation is hard
#
# * Good documentation is hard, and very expensive.
# * Bad documentation is detrimental.
# * Good documentation quickly becomes bad if not kept up-to-date with code changes.
# * Professional companies pay large teams of documentation writers.
#
# ## Prefer readable code with tests and vignettes
#
# If you don't have the capacity to maintain great documentation,
# focus on:
#
# * Readable code
# * Automated tests
# * Small code samples demonstrating how to use the api
#
# ## Comment-based Documentation tools
# 
# Documentation tools can produce extensive documentation about your code by pulling out comments near the beginning of functions,
# together with the signature, into a web page.
#
# The most popular is [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
#
# Here are some other documentation tools used in different languages, have a look at the generated and source examples:
#
# | Language | Name                                                                                | Output example                                                                      | source                                                                                                                                           |

#
# [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be used to make Sphinx and Doxygen work together (good to keep documentation, for example, of a C++ project that includes Python bindings). [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) is another good option for R packages.
# 
# ## Sphinx
# 
# ### Write some docstrings
# 
# We're going to document our "greeter" example from the previous section using docstrings with Sphinx.
#
# There are various conventions for how to write docstrings, but the native Sphinx one doesn't look nice when used with
# the built in `help` system.
#
# In writing Greeter, we used the [docstring conventions from NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/docs/howto_document.html).
# So we use the [`numpydoc`](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) sphinx extension to
# support these (**NOTE:** you will need to install this extension for the later examples to work).
# 
# ```python
# """ 
# Generate a greeting string for a person.
#
# Parameters
# ----------
# personal: str
#     A given name, such as Will or Jean-Luc
#
# family: str
#     A family name, such as Riker or Picard
#
# title: str
#     An optional title, such as Captain or Reverend
#
# polite: bool
#     True for a formal greeting, False for informal.
#
# Returns
# -------
# string
#     An appropriate greeting
# """
# ```
# 
# ### Set up Sphinx
# 
# Install Sphinx using the [appropiate instructions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) for your system following the documentation online.
# (Note that your output and the linked documentation may differ slightly depending on when you installed Sphinx and what version you're using.)
#
# Invoke the [sphinx-quickstart](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) command to build Sphinx's
# configuration file automatically based on questions
# at the command line:
# 
# ``` bash
# sphinx-quickstart
# ```
# 
# Which responds:
# 
# ```
# Welcome to the Sphinx 4.2.0 quickstart utility.
#
# Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
# accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).
#
# Selected root path: .
#
# You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
# Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
# "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
# > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:
#
# The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
# > Project name: Greetings
# > Author name(s): James Hetherington
# > Project release []: 0.1
#
# If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
# you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
# translate text that it generates into that language.
#
# For a list of supported codes, see
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
# > Project language [en]:
#
# Creating file ./conf.py.
# Creating file ./index.rst.
# Creating file ./Makefile.
# Creating file ./make.bat.
#
# Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.
#
# You should now populate your master file /tmp/index.rst and create other documentation
# source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
#    make builder
# where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
# ```
# 
# and then look at and adapt the generated config - a file called
# `conf.py` in the root of the project - with, for example, the extensions we want to use.
# This config file contains the project's Sphinx configuration, as Python variables:
# 
# ``` python
# #Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# #extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# # ones.
# extensions = [
#     'sphinx.ext.autodoc',  # Support automatic documentation
#     'sphinx.ext.coverage', # Automatically check if functions are documented
#     'sphinx.ext.mathjax',  # Allow support for algebra
#     'sphinx.ext.viewcode', # Include the source code in documentation
#     'numpydoc'             # Support NumPy style docstrings
# ]
# ```
# 
# To proceed with the example, we'll copy a finished conf.py into our folder, though normally you'll always use `sphinx-quickstart`

# %% jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# %%writefile greetings/conf.py

# %% [markdown]
# ### Define the root documentation page
#
# Sphinx uses [RestructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) another wiki markup format similar to Markdown.
#
# You define an "index.rst" file to contain any preamble text you want. The rest is autogenerated by `sphinx-quickstart`

# %% jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
# %%writefile greetings/index.rst
Welcome to Greetings's documentation!
=====================================

Simple "Hello, James" module developed to teach research software engineering.

.. autofunction:: greetings.greeter.greet


# %% [markdown]
# ### Run sphinx
#
# We can run Sphinx using:

# %% jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false} language="bash"
# cd greetings/
# sphinx-build . doc

# %% [markdown]
# ### Sphinx output
# 
# Sphinx's output is [html](./greetings/doc/index.html). We just created a simple single function's documentation, but Sphinx will create
# multiple nested pages of documentation automatically for many functions.
# 
# ## MkDocs
# 
# [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a static site generator that supports
# markdown content out of the box. The configuration is specified in a YAML
# file (`mkdocs.yml`) and it supports automatically rendering the docstrings
# in documentation through plugins like [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io).
# 
# mkdocstrings supports Google, NumPy, and the Sphinx docstring conventions.
# Moreover, MkDocs allows users to write documentation quicker, faster, and in
# an easier format than Sphinx, but Sphinx is more powerful in terms of
# customisability. For smaller projects, MkDocs works like a charm, but bigger
# projects such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org)
# use Sphinx (more specifically, the [PyData Sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io))
# for their documentation.
# 
# ## Doctest - testing your documentation is up to date
# 
# `doctest` is a module included in the standard library. It runs all the code within the docstrings and checks whether the output is what it's claimed on the documentation.
#
# Let's add an example to our greeting function and check it with `doctest`. We are leaving the output with a small typo (missing the closing quote `'`) to see what's the type of output we get from `doctest`.

# %%
# %%writefile greetings/greetings/greeter.py
