# We've seen that NumPy arrays are really useful. Why wouldn't we always want to use them for data which is all the same type?

# Let's look at appending data into a NumPy array, compared to a plain Python list: 

# %%
def time_append_to_ndarray(count):
    # the function repeat does the same that the `%timeit` magic
    # but as a function; so we can plot it.
    return repeat('np.append(before, [0])',
                  f'import numpy as np; before=np.ndarray({count})',

# Adding an element to a Python list is way faster! Also, it seems that adding an element to a Python list is independent of the length of the list, but it's not so for a NumPy array.
# 
# How do they perform when accessing an element in the middle?

# %%
def time_lookup_middle_element_in_list(count):
    before = [0] * count
    def totime():
        x = before[count // 2]

def time_lookup_middle_element_in_ndarray(count):

# %% [markdown]
# Both scale well for accessing the middle element.
# 
# What about inserting at the beginning?
#
# If we want to insert an element at the beginning of a Python list we can do:

# %%
x = list(range(5))
x

# %%
x[0:0] = [-1]
x


# %%
def time_insert_to_list(count):
    return repeat('before[0:0] = [0]',
                  f'before = [0] * {count}',number=10000)


# %%
plot_time(time_insert_to_list, counts)

# %% [markdown]
# `list` performs **badly** for insertions at the beginning!
# 
# There are containers in Python that work well for insertion at the start:

# %%
from collections import deque


# %%
def time_insert_to_deque(count):
    return repeat('before.appendleft(0)', 
                  f'from collections import deque; before = deque([0] * {count})',
                  number=10000)


# %%
plot_time(time_insert_to_deque, counts)

# %% [markdown]
# But looking up in the middle scales badly:

# %%
def time_lookup_middle_element_in_deque(count):
    before = deque([0] * count)
    def totime():
        x = before[count // 2]
    return repeat(totime, number=10000)

# What is going on here?
# 
# Arrays are stored as contiguous memory. Anything which changes the length of the array requires the whole array to be copied elsewhere in memory.
# 
# This copy takes time proportional to the array size.
# 
# ![Adding an element to an array - memory representation](./array_memory.svg)
# 
# The Python `list` type is **also** an array, but it is allocated with **extra memory**. Only when that memory is exhausted is a copy needed.
# 
# ![Adding an element to a list - memory representation](list_memory.svg)
# 
# If the extra memory is typically the size of the current array, a copy is needed every 1/N appends, and costs N to make, so **on average** copies are cheap. We call this **amortized constant time**. 
#
# This makes it fast to look up values in the middle. However, it may also use more space than is needed.
# 
# The deque type works differently: each element contains a pointer to the next. Inserting elements is therefore very cheap, but looking up the Nth element requires traversing N such pointers.
# 
# ![Adding an element to a deque - memory representation](deque_memory.svg)
# 
# ## Dictionary performance
# 
# For another example, let's consider the performance of a dictionary versus a couple of other ways in which we could implement an associative array.

# %%
class evildict:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        
    def __getitem__(self, akey):
        for key, value in self.data:
            if key == akey:
                return value
        raise KeyError()

# %% [markdown]
# If we have an evil dictionary of N elements, how long would it take - on average - to find an element?

# %%
eric = [["Name", "Eric Idle"], ["Job", "Comedian"], ["Home", "London"]]

# %%
eric_evil = evildict(eric)

# %%
eric_evil["Job"]

# %%
eric_dict = dict(eric)

# %%
eric_evil["Job"]

# %%
x = ["Hello", "License", "Fish", "Eric", "Pet", "Halibut"]

# %%
sorted(x, key=lambda el: el.lower())

# %% [markdown]
# What if we created a dictionary where we bisect the search?

# %%
class sorteddict:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = sorted(data, key = lambda x:x[0])
        self.keys = list(map(lambda x:x[0], self.data))
        
    def __getitem__(self,akey):
        from bisect import bisect_left
        loc = bisect_left(self.keys, akey)
        
        if loc != len(self.data):
            return self.data[loc][1]
        
        raise KeyError()

# %%
eric_sorted = sorteddict(eric)

# %%
eric_sorted["Job"]

# %%
def time_dict_generic(ttype, count, number=10000):
    from random import randrange
    keys = list(range(count))
    values = [0] * count
    data = ttype(list(zip(keys, values)))
    def totime():
        x = data[keys[count // 2]]
    return repeat(totime, number=10000)

# %%
time_dict = lambda count: time_dict_generic(dict, count)
time_sorted = lambda count: time_dict_generic(sorteddict, count)
time_evil = lambda count: time_dict_generic(evildict, count)

# %%
plot_time(time_sorted, counts, title='sorted')

# %% [markdown]
# We can't really see what's going on here for the sorted example as there's too much noise, but theoretically we should get **logarithmic** asymptotic performance. We write this down as $O(\ln N)$. This doesn't mean there isn't also a constant term, or a term proportional to something that grows slower (such as $\ln(\ln N)$): we always write down just the term that is dominant for large $N$. We saw before that `list` is $O(1)$ for appends, $O(N)$ for inserts. Numpy's `array` is $O(N)$ for appends.

# %%
counts = np.arange(1, 1000, 100)
plot_time(time_evil, counts, title='evil')

# %% [markdown]
# The simple check-each-in-turn solution is $O(N)$ - linear time.

# %%
counts = np.arange(1, 100000, 10000)

# Python's built-in dictionary is, amazingly, O(1): the time is **independent** of the size of the dictionary.

# This uses a miracle of programming called the _Hash Table_:

# Optional exercise: determine what the asymptotic peformance for the Boids model in terms of the number of Boids. Make graphs to support this. Bonus: how would the performance scale with the number of dimensions?
