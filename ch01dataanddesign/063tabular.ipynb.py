# # Field and Record Data (Tabular data)
#
# Tabular data, that is data that is formatted as a table with a fixed number of rows and columns, is very common in a research context. A particularly simple and also popular file format for such data is [_delimited-separated value_ files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values).
# 
# ## Delimiter-separated values
# 
# Let's carry on with our sunspots example. As we saw previously the data is semicolon-separated. 
#
# We can request the CSV file text from the URL we used previously:

# %%
# sending requests to the web is not fully supported on jupyterlite yet, and the
# cells below might error out on the browser (jupyterlite) version of this notebook
import requests
# Request sunspots data from URL and extract response content as text
sunspots_csv_text = requests.get('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php').text
# Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from CSV text to skip any empty rows
sunspots_csv_text = sunspots_csv_text.strip()

# %% [markdown]
# As a quick check we can split the text on the newline character `\n` and print the last five entries in the resulting list

# %%
print(sunspots_csv_text.split('\n')[-5:])

# %% [markdown]
# We see that each line is a string with numeric calues separted by semicolon delimiters. We want to work programmatically with such *delimited-separated value* files.

# %% [markdown]
# These are files which (typically) have
#
# * One *record* per line (row)
# * Each record has multiple *fields* (columns)
# * Fields are separated by some *delimiter*
# 
# Typical separators are the `space`, `tab`, `comma`, and `semicolon`, leading to correspondingly-named file formats, e.g.:
#
# * Space-separated value (e.g. `field1 "field two" field3` )
# * Comma-separated value (e.g. `field1, another field, "wow, another field"`)
# 
# Comma-separated value is abbreviated CSV, and tab-separated value TSV.
# 
# CSV is also sometimes used to refer to all the different sub-kinds of separated value files, i.e. some people use CSV to refer to tab-, space- and semicolon-separated files.
# 
# CSV is not a particularly superb data format, because it forces your data model to only have two 'axes', records and fields, with each record a flat object. As we will see in the next notebook, structured file formats can be used to represent a richer array of data formats, including for example hierarchically structured data where each record may itself have an internal structure.
# 
# Nevertheless, because you can always export *spreadsheets* as CSV files (each cell is a field, each row is a record), CSV files are very popular. 
# 
# ### CSV variants
# 
# Some CSV formats define a comment character, so that rows beginning with, e.g., a `#`, are not treated as data, but give a human comment.
# 
# Some CSV formats define a three-deep list structure, where a double-newline separates records into blocks.
# 
# Some CSV formats assume that the first line (also called a header) defines the names of the fields, e.g.:
#
# ```
# name, age
# James, 39
# Will, 2
# ```
# 
# ### Python `csv` module
# 
# The Python standard library provides a `csv` module for reading and writing delimited-separated value files, including, as the name suggests, CSV files. As it is built-in to all Python installations, it is useful to be familiar with the `csv` module as an option for loading and saving CSV formatted data, though the CSV capabilities in third-party libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) (which we will cover later in the course) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) are more powerful and will often be better options in practice.

# %%
import csv

# %% [markdown]
# The most straightforward way to read CSV files using the `csv` module is with the [`csv.reader` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader). This accepts an _iterable_ object as its first argument which returns a line of delimited input for each iteration. Commonly this will be an opened file object however it can also for example be a sequence of strings which is what we will use here by using the `split` method to convert the sunspot CSV text object into a list of per-line strings. The `csv.reader` function also accepts various optional keyword arguments including importantly a `delimiter` argument to specify the character used as the delimiter separating the values in each line, with we setting this to a semicolon here. 

# %%
csv_reader = csv.reader(sunspots_csv_text.split('\n'), delimiter=';')

# %% [markdown]
# The object returned by the `csv.reader` function is an iterator over the rows of the CSV file, with each row being returned as a list of the separated values in the row (with all values being read as strings by default). We can read all of the data in to a nested list-of-lists using a list comprehension:

# %%
sunspots_data = [row for row in csv_reader]
print(sunspots_data[-5:])

# %% [markdown]
# For this particular CSV file the first column corresponds to the measurement year, the second the measurement month number and the third the measurement date as a 'fractional year'. We can extract a list of the just the (fractional) years converted to floating point values using another list comprehension

# %%
fractional_years = [float(row[2]) for row in sunspots_data]

# %% [markdown]
# Similarly the fourth column in the CSV file contains the monthly mean total sunspot number, which we can extract with another list comprehension

# %%
monthly_mean_total_sunspot_numbers = [float(row[3]) for row in sunspots_data]

# %% [markdown]
# We can then for example use Matplotlib to create a plot of how the monthly average sunspot number varies over time, with this highlighting [the cyclic nature of sunspot activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle)

# %%
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(fractional_years, monthly_mean_total_sunspot_numbers)
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Monthly mean total sunspot number');

# %% [markdown]
# #### Reading rows as dictionaries
# 
# Accessing the values in each row by an index corresponding to their column can be unclear and prone to bugs. The `csv` module also provides the `csv.DictReader` class to allow reading each record (line) in the CSV file as a dictionary keyed by a set of field names. For the dataset we are using [we have the columns correspond to](http://www.sidc.be/silso/infosnmtot)
#
# ```
# Column 1-2: Gregorian calendar date
# - Year
# - Month
# Column 3: Date in fraction of year.
# Column 4: Monthly mean total sunspot number.
# Column 5: Monthly mean standard deviation of the input sunspot numbers.
# Column 6: Number of observations used to compute the monthly mean total sunspot number.
# Column 7: Definitive/provisional marker. '1' indicates that the value is definitive. '0' indicates that the value is still provisional.
# ```
#
# We can create an instance of the `csv.DictReader` class very similarly to how we called the `csv.reader` function, but with an additional keyword argument `fieldnames` specifying a sequence of strings corresponding to the keys to associate the values in each row with. Below we also set the optional keyword argument `quoting` to the special constant `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` which causes all non-quoted values in each line to be automatically converted to floating point values.

# %%
csv_reader = csv.DictReader(
    sunspots_csv_text.split('\n'),
    fieldnames=['year', 'month', 'fractional_year', 'mean', 'deviation', 'observations', 'definitive'],
    delimiter=';',
    quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC
)

# %% [markdown]
# Similarly to previously we can now extract all the data using a list comprehension, with the difference being that each item in the constructed list is now a dictionary keyed by the field names:

# %%
sunspots_data = [record for record in csv_reader]
print(sunspots_data[-1])

# %% [markdown]
# We can then recreate the same plot as previously as follows, with the intention of the list comprehensions extracting the year and mean values now much more apparent

# %%
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.plot([r['fractional_year'] for r in sunspots_data], [r['mean'] for r in sunspots_data])
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Monthly mean total sunspot number');

# %% [markdown]
# #### Writing CSV files
#
# The `csv` module also provides functionality for writing delimiter-separated value files. The `csv.writer` function provides a simple interface for writing CSV files row by row, with the function accepting a file object (and optional keyword arugments specifying formatting options such as `delimiter`) and the returned object providing a `writerow` method to write a sequence of values to the file as a delimiter-separated string. For example we can save a table of data about the planets in the solar system as a comma-separated values file using the following code snippet

# %%
planets_data = [
    ['Name', 'Mean distance from sun / AU', 'Orbit period / years', 'Mass / MðŸœ¨', 'Radius / RðŸœ¨', 'Number of satellites'],
    ['Mercury', 0.39, 0.24, 0.06, 0.38, 0],
    ['Venus', 0.72, 0.62, 0.82, 0.95, 0],
    ['Earth', 1., 1., 1., 1., 1],
    ['Mars', 1.5, 1.9, 0.11, 0.53, 2],
    ['Jupiter', 5.2, 12., 320., 11., 63],
    ['Saturn', 9.5, 29., 95., 9.4, 61],
    ['Uranus', 19., 84., 15., 4.1, 27],
    ['Neptune', 30., 170., 17., 3.9, 14],
]

with open('planets_data.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')
    for row in planets_data:
        csv_writer.writerow(row)

# %% [markdown]
# A [`csv.DictWriter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter) class is also provided which analogously to the  `csv.DictReader` class, allows writing a CSV file using rows specified by dictionaries mapping from field names to values.
# 
# ### NumPy's CSV readers
# 
# The Python standard library `csv` module seen in the preceding section is less powerful than the CSV capabilities in NumPy,
# the main scientific Python library for handling data. NumPy is distributed with Anaconda and Canopy, so we recommend use that when available.
# 
# NumPy has powerful capabilities for handling matrices, and other fun stuff, and we'll learn about these later in the course,
# but for now, we'll use NumPy's CSV reader, and assume it gives us lists and dictionaries, rather than its more exciting `array` type.

# %%
import numpy as np

# %%
spots = requests.get('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php', stream=True)

# %% [markdown]
# `stream=True` delays loading all of the data until it is required.

# %%
sunspots = np.genfromtxt(spots.raw, delimiter=';')

# %% [markdown]
# `genfromtxt` is a powerful CSV reader. We used the `delimiter` optional argument to specify the delimeter. We could also specify
# `names=True` if we had a first line naming fields, and `comments=#` if we had comment lines.

# %%
sunspots[0][3]

# %% [markdown]
# As before, we can now plot the "Sunspot cycle", note how we can specify the column directly from the data we've read.

# %%
# %matplotlib inline

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(sunspots[:,2], sunspots[:,3]) # Numpy syntax to access all 
                                       # rows, specified column.

# %% [markdown]
# The plot command accepted an array of 'X' values and an array of 'Y' values. We used a special NumPy "`:`" syntax,
# which we'll learn more about later. Don't worry about the `%matplotlib` magic command for now - we'll also look at this later.
# 
# `genfromtxt` also allows naming the columns. Similarly of what we've done with the `csv.DictReader`. We do that by specifying the column information to the formatter:

# %%
spots = requests.get('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php', stream=True)

sunspots = np.genfromtxt(spots.raw, delimiter=';', 
                         names=['year','month','date',
                         'mean','deviation','observations','definitive'])

# %%
sunspots

# %% [markdown]
# Going a step further, as we know what's expected on each column, it's then good to specify the datatype of each field.

# %%
spots = requests.get('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php', stream=True)

sunspots = np.genfromtxt(spots.raw, delimiter=';', 
                         names=['year','month','date',
                         'mean','deviation','observations','definitive'],
                         dtype=[int, int, float, float, float, int, int])

# %%
sunspots

# %% [markdown]
# Now, NumPy understands the names of the columns, so our plot command is more readable:

# %%
sunspots['year']

# %%
plt.plot(sunspots['year'], sunspots['mean'])

# %% [markdown]
# ### Pandas - a more powerful CSV reader
# 
# If most of your work is going to be working with CSV files, then, most probably you will enjoy the powers that [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) provide. Whereas numpy uses arrays, pandas work with [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html), that's how they name to their representation of data in a table (2D arrays).
#
# Let's see how we would use it for this example.

# %%
import pandas as pd

spots = requests.get('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php', stream=True)

sunspots = pd.read_csv(spots.raw, delimiter=';',
                       names=['year','month','date',
                               'mean','deviation','observations','definitive'])
sunspots

# %% [markdown]
# In pandas, then you can access to the data of their columns as with a dictionaries.

# %%
sunspots['year']

# %% [markdown]
# And ploting the data is directly available from the object.

# %%
sunspots.plot('year', 'mean')

# %% [markdown]
# Note how, automatically, pandas sets the axis labels and the legend. We will learn how to set these up later in this chapter.
# 
# You can learn more about pandas with the [Software carpentry's Plotting and Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson.
