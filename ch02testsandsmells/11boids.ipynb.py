# # Exercise: Refactoring The Bad Boids
# 
# ## Bad_Boids
#
# We have written some _very bad_ code implementing our Boids flocking example.
#
# Here's the [Github link](https://github.com/UCL-ARC-RSEing-with-Python/bad-boids).
#
# Please fork it on GitHub, and clone your fork.
# 
# ``` bash
# git clone      git@github.com:yourname/bad-boids.git 
# # OR git clone https://github.com/yourname/bad-boids.git
# ```
# 
# For the Exercise, you should start from the GitHub repository, but here's our terrible code:

# ## Your Task
# 
# Transform bad_boids **gradually** into better code, while making sure it still works, using a Refactoring approach.
# 
# ## A regression test
# 
# First, have a look at the regression test we made.
#
# To create it, we saved out the before and after state
# for one iteration of some boids, using ipython:
# 
# ``` python
# import yaml
# import boids
# from copy import deepcopy
#
# before = deepcopy(boids.boids)
# boids.update_boids(boids.boids)
# after = boids.boids
# fixture = {"before": before, "after": after}
# fixture_file = open("fixture.yml", 'w')
# fixture_file.write(yaml.dump(fixture))
# fixture_file.close()
# ```
# 
# ## Invoking the test
# 
# Then, I used the fixture file to define the test:
#
# ``` python
# from boids import update_boids
# from nose.tools import assert_almost_equal
# import os
# import yaml
#
# def test_bad_boids_regression():
#     regression_data = yaml.safe_load(open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'fixture.yml')))
#     boid_data = regression_data["before"]
#     update_boids(boid_data)
#     for after, before in zip(regression_data["after"], boid_data):
#         for after_value, before_value in zip(after, before): 
#             assert_almost_equal(after_value, before_value, delta=0.01)
# ```
# 
# ## Make the regression test fail
# 
# Check the tests pass:
# 
# ``` bash
# pytest
# ```
#
# Edit the file to make the test fail, see the fail, then reset it:
#
# ```
# git checkout boids.py
# ```
# 
# ## Start Refactoring
# 
# Look at the code, consider the [list of refactorings](./05refactoring.html#refactoring-summary), and make changes.
#
# Each time, do a git commit on your fork, and write a commit message explaining the 
# refactoring you did.
#
# Try to keep the changes as small as possible.
#
# If your refactoring creates any units, (functions, modules, or classes)
# **write a unit test** for the unit: it is a good idea to get away from regression testing as soon as you can.
