# # How to Test
# 
# ## Equivalence partitioning
# 
# Think hard about the different cases the code will run under: this is science, not coding!
# 
# We can't write a test for every possible input: this is an infinite amount of work.
# 
# We need to write tests to rule out different bugs. There's no need to separately test *equivalent* inputs. 
# 
# Let's look at an example of this question outside of coding:
# 
# * Research Project : Evolution of agricultural fields in Saskatchewan from aerial photography
# * In silico translation  : Compute overlap of two rectangles

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.path import Path
import matplotlib.patches as patches
# %matplotlib inline

# %% [markdown]
# Let's make a little fragment of matplotlib code to visualise a pair of fields.

# %%
def show_fields(field1, field2):
    def vertices(left, bottom, right, top):
        verts = [(left, bottom),
                 (left, top),
                 (right, top),
                 (right, bottom),
                 (left, bottom)]
        return verts
    
    codes = [Path.MOVETO,
             Path.LINETO,
             Path.LINETO,
             Path.LINETO,
             Path.CLOSEPOLY]
    path1 = Path(vertices(*field1), codes)
    path2 = Path(vertices(*field2), codes)         
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    patch1 = patches.PathPatch(path1, facecolor='orange', lw=2)
    patch2 = patches.PathPatch(path2, facecolor='blue', lw=2)         
    ax.add_patch(patch1)
    ax.add_patch(patch2)       
    ax.set_xlim(0,5)
    ax.set_ylim(0,5)

show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.), (2.,2.,3.,3.))

# %% [markdown]
# Here, we can see that the area of overlap, is the same as the smaller field, with area 1.
# 
# We could now go ahead and write a subroutine to calculate that, and also write some test cases for our answer.
# 
# But first, let's just consider that question abstractly, what other cases, *not equivalent to this* might there be?
# 
# For example, this case, is still just a full overlap, and is sufficiently equivalent that it's not worth another test:

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.5,1.7,3.2,3.4))

# %% [markdown]
# But this case is no longer a full overlap, and should be tested separately:

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,3.,4.5))

# %% [markdown]
# On a piece of paper, sketch now the other cases you think should be treated as non-equivalent. Some answers are below:

# %%
for _ in range(10):
    print("\n\n\nSpoiler space\n\n\n")

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2,2,4.5,4.5)) # Overlap corner

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,3.,4.)) # Just touching

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(4.5,4.5,5,5)) # No overlap

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.5,4,3.5,4.5)) # Just touching from outside

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(4,4,4.5,4.5)) # Touching corner

# %% [markdown]
# ## Using our tests
# 
# OK, so how might our tests be useful?
# 
# Here's some code that **might** correctly calculate the area of overlap:

# %%
def overlap(field1, field2):
    left1, bottom1, top1, right1 = field1
    left2, bottom2, top2, right2 = field2
    overlap_left = max(left1, left2)
    overlap_bottom = max(bottom1, bottom2)
    overlap_right = min(right1, right2)
    overlap_top = min(top1, top2)
    overlap_height = (overlap_top-overlap_bottom)
    overlap_width = (overlap_right-overlap_left)
    return overlap_height * overlap_width


# %% [markdown]
# So how do we check our code?
# 
# The manual approach would be to look at some cases, and, once, run it and check:

# %%
overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,3.,3.))

# %% [markdown]
# That looks OK.
# 
# But we can do better, we can write code which **raises an error** if it gets an unexpected answer:

# %%
assert overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,3.,3.)) == 1.0

# %%
assert overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,3.,4.5)) == 2.0 

# %%
assert overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(2.,2.,4.5,4.5)) == 4.0 

# %%
assert overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(4.5,4.5,5,5)) == 0.0 

# %%
print(overlap((1.,1.,4.,4.),(4.5,4.5,5,5)))

# %%
show_fields((1.,1.,4.,4.),(4.5,4.5,5,5))

# %% [markdown]
# What? Why is this wrong?
# 
# In our calculation, we are actually getting:

# %%
overlap_left = 4.5
overlap_right = 4
overlap_width = -0.5
overlap_height = -0.5

# %% [markdown]
# Both width and height are negative, resulting in a positive area.
# The above code didn't take into account the non-overlap correctly.
# 
# It should be:

# %%
def overlap(field1, field2):
    left1, bottom1, top1, right1 = field1
    left2, bottom2, top2, right2 = field2
    
    overlap_left = max(left1, left2)
    overlap_bottom = max(bottom1, bottom2)
    overlap_right = min(right1, right2)
    overlap_top = min(top1, top2)
    
    overlap_height = max(0, (overlap_top-overlap_bottom))
    overlap_width = max(0, (overlap_right-overlap_left))
    
    return overlap_height*overlap_width


# %%
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (2,2,3,3)) == 1.0
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (2,2,3,4.5)) == 2.0 
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (2,2,4.5,4.5)) == 4.0 
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (4.5,4.5,5,5)) == 0.0 
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (2.5,4,3.5,4.5)) == 0.0 
assert overlap((1,1,4,4), (4,4,4.5,4.5)) == 0.0 


# %% [markdown]
# Note, we reran our other tests, to check our fix didn't break something else. (We call that "fallout")
# 
# ## Boundary cases
# 
# "Boundary cases" are an important area to test:
#
# * Limit between two equivalence classes: edge and corner sharing fields
# * Wherever indices appear, check values at ``0``, ``N``, ``N+1``
# * Empty arrays:

# %% [markdown] attributes={"classes": [" python"], "id": ""}
# ``` python
#     atoms = [read_input_atom(input_atom) for input_atom in input_file]
#     energy = force_field(atoms)
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# * What happens if ``atoms`` is an empty list?
# * What happens when a matrix/data-frame reaches one row, or one column?
# 
# ## Positive *and* negative tests
#
# * **Positive tests**: code should give correct answer with various inputs
# * **Negative tests**: code should crash as expected given invalid inputs, rather than lying
#
# <div align="left">
# Bad input should be expected and should fail early and explicitly.
#
# <div class="fragment roll-in">
# Testing should ensure that explicit failures do indeed happen.
# 
# ## Raising exceptions
# 
# In Python, we can signal an error state by raising an error:

# %% attributes={"classes": [" python"], "id": ""}
def I_only_accept_positive_numbers(number):
    # Check input
    if number < 0: 
        raise ValueError("Input {} is negative".format(number))

    # Do something

# %%
I_only_accept_positive_numbers(5)

# %%
I_only_accept_positive_numbers(-5)

# %% [markdown]
# There are standard "Exception" types, like `ValueError` we can `raise`
# 
# We would like to be able to write tests like this:

# %%
assert I_only_accept_positive_numbers(-5) == # Gives a value error

# %% [markdown]
# But to do that, we need to learn about more sophisticated testing tools, called "test frameworks".
