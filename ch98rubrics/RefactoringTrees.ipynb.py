# # Refactoring Trees: An exercise in Research Software Engineering

# %% [markdown]
# In this exercise, you will convert badly written code, provided here, into better-written code.

# %% [markdown]
# You will do this not through simply writing better code, but by taking a refactoring approach, as discussed in the lectures.

# %% [markdown]
# As such, your use of `git` version control, to make a commit after each step of the refactoring, with a commit message which indicates the refactoring you took, will be critical to success.
#

# %% [markdown]
# You will also be asked to look at the performance of your code, and to make changes which improve the speed of the code.

# %% [markdown]
# The script as supplied has its parameters hand-coded within the code. You will be expected, in your refactoring, to make these available as command line parameters to be supplied when the code is invoked.

# %% [markdown]
# # Some terrible code

# %% [markdown]
# Here's our terrible code:

# %%
# %matplotlib inline

# %%
from math import sin, cos
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
s=1
d=[[0,1,0]]
plt.plot([0,0],[0,1])
for i in range(5):
    n=[]
    for j in range(len(d)):
        n.append([d[j][0]+s*sin(d[j][2]-0.2), d[j][1]+s*cos(d[j][2]-0.2), d[j][2]-0.2])
        n.append([d[j][0]+s*sin(d[j][2]+0.2), d[j][1]+s*cos(d[j][2]+0.2), d[j][2]+0.2])
        plt.plot([d[j][0], n[-2][0]],[d[j][1], n[-2][1]])
        plt.plot([d[j][0], n[-1][0]],[d[j][1], n[-1][1]])
    d=n
    s*=0.6
plt.savefig('tree.png')

# # Rubric and marks scheme
#
# ## Part one: Refactoring (15 marks)
#

# %% [markdown]
# * Copy the code above into a file tree.py, invoke it with python tree.py, and verify it creates an image tree.png which looks like that above.
# * Initialise your git repository with the raw state of the code. [1 mark]
# * Identify a number of simple refactorings which can be used to improve the code, *reducing repetition* and *improving readability*. Implement these one by one, with a git commit each time.
#     * 1 mark for each refactoring, 1 mark for each git commit, at least five such: ten marks total.
# * Do NOT introduce NumPy or other performance improvements yet (see below.)

# %% [markdown]
# * Identify which variables in the code would, more sensibly, be able to be input parameters, and use Argparse to manage these.
#    * 4 marks: 1 for each of four arguments identified.

# %% [markdown]
# ##Â Part two: performance programming (10 marks)

# %% [markdown]
# * For the code as refactored, prepare a figure which plots the time to produce the tree, versus number of iteration steps completed. Your code to produce this figure should run as a script, which you should call perf_plot.py, invoking a function imported from tree.py. The script should produce a figure called perf_plot.png. Comment on your findings in a text file, called comments.md. You should turn off the actual plotting, and run only the mathematical calculation, for your performance measurements. (Add an appropriate flag.)
#    * 5 marks: [1] Time to run code identified [1] Figure created [1] Figure correctly formatted [1] Figure auto-generated from script [1] Performance law identified.

# %% [markdown]
# * The code above makes use of `append()` which is not appropriate for NumPy. Create a new solution (in a file called tree_np.py) which makes use of NumPy. Compare the performance (again, excluding the plotting from your measurements), and discuss in comments.md
#     * 5 marks: [1] NumPy solution uses array-operations to subtract the change angle from all angles in a single minus sign, [1] to take the sine of all angles using np.sin [1] to move on all the positions with a single vector displacement addition [1] Numpy solution uses `hstack` or similar to create new arrays with twice the length, by composing the left-turned array with the right-turned array [1] Performance comparison recorded

# %% [markdown]
# As with assignment one, to facilitate semi-automated marking, submit your code to moodle as a single Zip file (not .tgz, nor any other zip format), which unzips to produce files in a folder named with your **student number**.
